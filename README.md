# Ray Tracing
Implementation of some features of the Ray Tracing algorithm, which makes possible generating really realistic 3D-like images by using concepts of Physics.

This is the main project of the Computer Graphics course at UFRN, taught by Bruno Motta in the 2022.1 semester. It is incremental; each vXX folder in this repo corresponds to a version of it.

# Ray Tracing
Implementation of some features of the Ray Tracing algorithm, which makes possible generating really realistic 3D-like images by using concepts of Physics.

This is the main project of the Computer Graphics course at UFRN, which is being taught by Selan. It is incremental; each projXX folder in this repo corresponds to a version of it.
